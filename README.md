Project Title:
MediFind: AI-Powered Symptom-to-Care Assistant

Problem Statement
Patients often donâ€™t know the right hospital or care for their symptoms, 
leading to delays or unnecessary visits. MediFind AI lets users speak their symptoms, predicts the likely disease, 
and recommends the appropriate hospital. For mild conditions, it offers video consultations and home medicine delivery, 
while for serious cases, it can dispatch an ambulance, ensuring timely, safe, and convenient care
